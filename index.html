    <p style="text-align: center justify; font-size: 30px; ">Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) is an innovative cell under Ministry of Education (MoE) at AICTE, New Delhi. 
       It aims to aid research on all fields of IKS. The research umbrella covers all aspects of Indian culture and heritage ranging from education oriented fields like 
       math and science, and extra curriculars like arts and yoga.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 55px; text-align: center; margin-top: 9%;">Why do we need IKS ?</p>
    <p style="text-align: center justify; font-size: 30px; ">India as a country is extremely rich in its heritage and culture. Scholars have made numerous contributions in various fields thereby leading to a wider scope 
       for research. The aim of IKS is to make people aware about these findings and also encourage them to come up with ideas of their own.</p>
